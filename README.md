# 🖼️ [Arabic Image Captioning Shared Task 2025](https://sina.birzeit.edu/image_eval2025/index.html)

This repository contains official baselines for the **Arabic Image Captioning Shared Task 2025**, which aims to advance the development of culturally aware Arabic image captioning models. The task provides an Arabic-language dataset and invites participants to generate natural captions for images using zero-shot or fine-tuned approaches. This repository includes two baseline systems using Qwen2.5-VL 7B, along with an evaluation script.

** Fine-tuned Model**: [Sinalab/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-Image-Captioning](https://huggingface.co/Sinalab/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-Image-Captioning)

## 📂 Contents

- A zero-shot baseline for generating captions using Qwen2.5-VL 7B without fine-tuning.
- A fine-tuned baseline using Qwen2.5-VL 7B trained on the provided Arabic-captioned training set.
- An evaluation script to compare predictions with ground truth using the official metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, and LLM as a Judge).

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comprises images with Arabic captions. It is divided into:

- **Training Set**
- **Development Set**
- **Test Set**

To participate in the shared task and get a training and development dataset, please register in ([the official registration form](https://forms.gle/qn4NDr6PYW49bLns7)). The test dataset will be shared only during the test phase in the shared task ([see the deadlines](https://sina.birzeit.edu/image_eval2025/index.html))


## 🗂️ Project Structure

This repository is organized into three main components:

### [`ImageValZeroShot/`](./ImageValZeroShot/)
Contains the zero-shot baseline implementation for generating Arabic captions without any fine-tuning. See the [Zero-Shot README](./ImageValZeroShot/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

### [`ImageValFinetune/`](./ImageValFinetune/)  
Contains the fine-tuning pipeline for training Qwen2.5-VL on Arabic image captions using LoRA. See the [Fine-tuning README](./ImageValFinetune/README.md) for comprehensive training and evaluation guidance.

### [`Evaluation/`](./Evaluation/)
Contains the evaluation framework for measuring caption quality using multiple metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, and LLM-based evaluation. See the [Evaluation README](./Evaluation/README.md) for metric details and usage.


## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Choose your approach**: 
   - For zero-shot inference: Navigate to [`ImageValZeroShot/`](./ImageValZeroShot/)
   - For fine-tuning: Navigate to [`ImageValFinetune/`](./ImageValFinetune/)

2. **Follow the respective README**: Each directory contains detailed instructions for setup, dependencies, and execution.

3. **Evaluate results**: Use the evaluation framework in [`Evaluation/`](./Evaluation/) to measure your model's performance.
